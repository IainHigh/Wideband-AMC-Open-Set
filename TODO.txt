1) Fix the model such that Open-Set recognition works when merging multiple predictions for the same transmission.
2) Make sure the model still works with open-set recognition disabled.
3) The current issue with the models open-set recognition performance is only when there's multiple transmitters. Look into why this is and resolve it. Could it be due to overlapping signals / noise? How is the accuracy of closed-set with multiple transmitters? When there's no overlapping signals it should be identical to multiple.

1) Fix the model such that Open-Set recognition works when merging multiple predictions for the same transmission. Merge based on embedding distance if OSR is enabled - confidence if OSR is disabled.
2) Make sure the model still works with open-set recognition disabled.
3) Implement Rician and Rayleigh channel models back into generator.py when required. Currently removed due to the issue faced with AWGN stacking - decreasing the SNR when multiple transmissions were present.
